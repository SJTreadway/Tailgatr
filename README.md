# Tailgatr

I am a huge Alabama fan, Roll Tide! I also love tailgating on the quad every home game. I wanted to build an app that allowed fans to reserve their spot for each game and also view the spots that were already taken by other fans. This app shows my Angular and Firebase abilities. I also used the Google Maps API. I'm very proud of the way this app turned out! So have a look and reserve your spot before they are all taken!
